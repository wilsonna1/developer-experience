# Nate's Software Dev Experience


* I have practice using C++, Python, JavaScript, Dart, SQL, Scala, Git, and the Linux command line.
* I've spent the past several months developing an Android app for MindBeWell LLC, which is set to be released for alpha testing by the end of April.
* I worked with [the Collaboratory](https://thecollaboratory.ai/collaboratory/) to scrape thousands of web pages for public materials science data, facilitating easy access of datasets for researchers and scientists.
* I used JavaScript to build an [online “Bop it!” game](https://bopthat.herokuapp.com/game) that lets you play & compare scores with people around the world. I composed the soundtrack for it as well :D
* I’ve developed code for use in virtual TTRPGs, specifically [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) and [5eTools](https://5e.tools/).
* I built an awesome [calculator Chrome extension](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JM1_pDK73Zyd1hE2puq1gGCEYej1L9qn/view?usp=sharing) using the Desmos API (and I use it on a daily basis!)

But one fact ensures the success of Open Doors more than anything else: my own dating life depends on this.
